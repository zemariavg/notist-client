**Project Guide**
We'll choose Security Challenge A.
# User Note Powers (Server side enforcement)
Any edit (title, content, collaborators) is a note modification.
Dates and last modified by are modified automatically on write.
## Owner
Can view everything.
Can edit note content and title.
Can add or remove editors/viewers.
Can delete note.
Can check integrity.
## Editor
Can view everything.
Can edit note content and title.
## Viewer
Can view note content and title.

**IMPORTANT:** With Security challenge A, anyone can check integrity!
# **Assumptions** (important!)
1. DB is previously populated with all user info
2. Entities have each others certificates(i.e. public keys), so TLS setup is easy
3. TLS ensures safety against replay attacks!
4. Authentication: user and password, returns session token that is used to validate every action requested by user.
5. Adding editors/viewers: Owner requests server to add editor/viewer. If editor/viewer is a legitimate user, server returns to client its public key. With this editor/viewer public key, client can cipher the symmetric key used to cipher note and send to server.

# Client side Features
- [ ] Create note
- [ ] Edit note
- [ ] Save note
- [ ] Send notes (push to server our local notes)
- [ ] Request notes (checks if any note is missing from server, **RUNS ALWAYS AT STARTUP**, and, if client requests)
- [ ] Edit editors and viewers (if owner)
- [ ] Check note integrity (when client requests)

# The NotIST notes app
* Security Requirements:
### *Confidentiality* - SR1
Only the *owner* of the notes can see their content.
* (locally, before they are shared)
### *Integrity 1* - SR2
The *owner* of the notes can verify they were not tampered with.
 * 
### *Integrity 2* - SR3
The *owner* of the notes can verify if some noteÂ is missing.
* A note is missing locally or in the server. Keep track of local notes and what notes were sent to server. Owner can check notes and local state to check if any are missing. Upon retrieval from server, owner can check if retrieved state matches state that he sent.
### *Authentication* - SR4
Only the *owner* of the notes can access them.
